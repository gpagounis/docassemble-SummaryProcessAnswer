question: |
  Your rights as a tenant
subquestion: |
  You have the right to legally withhold rent if your landlord has failed to keep the property in habitable condition and you have asked your landlord in writing to make the repairs and your local Board of Health has inspected the property and found violations and told your landlord; or you are current in your rent up until the time your landlord learned of the problem, you are not the cause of the problem, and the conditions do not require you to move out to make repairs.
  
  Examples of conditions that may make a property uninhabitable are cockroaches and rodents, plumbing issues, no hot water or not enough hot water, no heat or not enough heat, leaking roof, black mold, lead paint. 
  It will be up to the judge or jury to decide if you qualify for this defense.
fields:

    datatype: yesno

id: Defenses against eviction
question: |
  Defenses against eviction
subquestion: |
  You may have a defense because of the COVID-19 emergency:
  
  • If your landlord has a federally funded mortgage or you live in federally assisted property covered by the CARE Act
  
  • If you have asked for help from RAFT or another rental help program and your rent is late because RAFT has not paid it yet
  
  • Your landlord did not send a copy of the “Form to Accompany the Residential Notice to Quit” (257 form)
  
  If you have been discriminated against, violation of the discrimination laws is a defense to an eviction, even if you are being evicted for a reason that the landlord says is your fault. A major principle of discrimination law that can be used to prevent an eviction is the requirement that landlords make reasonable accommodations for tenants with physical and mental disabilities. Discrimination may include:
  
  • Not wanting to rent to children (maybe because of lead paint)
  
  • Not wanting to make changes to rules or the property to help a tenant with a disability
  
  • Not wanting to accept a Section 8 voucher or other rental assistance
  
  • Treating someone unfairly because of race, sex, religion, veteran status, or gender or sexuality
  
  You may have a defense under the Violence Against Women Act. If you are a survivor of sexual assault, abuse, rape, or stalking and your landlord is evicting you for breaking your lease or changing your locks for safety reasons, you may have a defense. This will be up to the judge or jury.
  
  If your lease requires that your landlord give you a 30-day notice to quit for nonpayment of rent, but they did not give you a 30-day notice, you may have a defense. It is important for your landlord to file your case properly. 
  
  Your landlord may not have correctly followed Massachusetts Security Deposit laws. In MA, a landlord can only charge a tenant one month’s rent for a security deposit, and they have to give the tenant a receipt that shows the amount of the deposit. The deposit had to be kept in an interest-bearing account, and they have to let the tenant know which bank the deposit is being kept in as well as the bank account number.
fields:
  - "I have other defenses against eviction.": defenses_yes
    datatype: yesno
  - "What other defenses against eviction do you have?": defenses
    input type: area
---
id: Counterclaims
question: |
  Counterclaims
subquestion: |
  If you believe that you are entitled to a return of part of your rent payment or other damages from your landlord, you may request a counterclaim against your landlord.
fields:
  - "How much money should you get in a counterclaim?": counterclaim_value
    datatype: currency
    min: 0
  - "Why should you get money in a counterclaim?": counterclaim_reasons
    input type: area
